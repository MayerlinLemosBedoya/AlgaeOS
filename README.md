# 🌿 AlgaeOS – River Sponsorships

**AlgaeOS** is an environmental Web3 platform that connects sponsors, researchers, and local communities to restore rivers using **microalgae**.  
Through blockchain transparency and stablecoin transactions (PayPal USD - PYUSD), users can fund ecological milestones and track their impact in real time.

## 🌱 Key Features

- 💧 **PYUSD Sponsorships:** Sponsors can send **PayPal USD** to support microalgae seeding campaigns.
- 🔬 **Milestone Verification:** Field reports can be uploaded and verified through smart contracts.
- 📊 **Marketplace Integration:** Purchase and trade microalgae lots transparently.
- 🧭 **Blockscout Verification:** Smart contracts are verified on testnet for open accountability.
- 🔐 **Lit Protocol (Planned):** Secures and encrypts access to scientific reports for verified users.
- 🌍 **Scientific Visualization:** Educational illustrations explain how microalgae contribute to water purification and oxygen production.

## 💡 How It Works

1. A sponsor connects their wallet and selects a **river restoration campaign**.  
2. The amount (in kg of microalgae) is converted to **PYUSD**.  
3. Once funded, the project milestone (e.g., *seeding phase*) begins.  
4. Researchers upload progress reports verified by smart contracts.  
5. Sponsors can track their impact via Blockscout and receive proof of contribution.
